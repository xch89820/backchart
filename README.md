## Compiling JavaScript
### Install Grunt
From the command line:

1. Install `grunt-cli` globally with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.
2. Navigate to the root directory, then run `npm install`. npm will look at [package.json](https://github.com/todc/todc-bootstrap/blob/master/package.json) and automatically install the necessary local dependencies listed there.

When completed, you'll be able to run the various Grunt commands provided from the command line.

**Unfamiliar with `npm`? Don't have node installed?** That's a-okay. npm stands for [node packaged modules](http://npmjs.org/) and is a way to manage development dependencies through node.js. [Download and install node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/) before proceeding.

#### Build - `grunt`
Run `grunt` to run tests locally and compile the JavaScript into `/dist`.

#### Build JSDoc - `jsdoc`
Run `jsdoc * ../README.md -d ../docs/jsdoc/` in `/src` directory, the API document will be find in the `docs/jsdoc` directory
